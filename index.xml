I had not updated it for almost 6 years. Lot has changed since then. My son Ryan has joined my life&amp;rsquo;s journey, I have got involved deeper into physical computing, my tech job profile and related tools, languages have also changed significantly. While the old website had some general musing and mostly chef, system automation related content, this new version will reflect my current experience in similar domain but also my hobbies.</description></item></channel></rss>
