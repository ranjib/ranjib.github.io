<p>Grown in a small town, i had always dream to farm. Cultivation. But looking at the current farmer suicide rate in india (specially in maharastra) , i dont think agricultural farming is a good move. I am still able to earn considerable amount of money in software industry.</p>
<p>Was chatting with "the papa" (will be introduce in greater depth in follow up post) on the prospects of farming. "The papa"&nbsp; suggested&nbsp; honey bee farming. Its cheap, profitable and require less space. May be one can do it in his/her balcony?</p>
<p>But i think one should try ostrich farming.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They are amusing!</p>
