    <p>Recentlyi had attended agile india 2012 conference. It was predominantly on agile methodologies, lean, kanban etc, mostly non technical in nature. The conference had 7 stages and devops was one of them. The stage was well attended, folk from agical talked about their experience with graphite. Bryce from Atlassian talked about how JIRA team used a combination of puppet and kanban for their operations. It was a really good talk. There were folks from multunous and tcs talking about their experiences also. I spoke about how to extract operations intelligence from infrastructure and use it as a feedback for product development. Hardly any body atteneded the talk :-). Still it was fun!</p>
